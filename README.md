My voron mods


These are the mods I have made for my Voron printers, not a lot here, just a Stealthburner mount for the Creality Spider Pro, that can be found here. https://a.co/d/guljvzE

This is Tap Compatible and CW2 compatible, it requires 4 m2.5 screws, they are M2.5x8 or M2.5x6 I honestly can't remember.

Only thing, if you manage to get an old revision of the Spider Pro, you will need to drill the thermistor hole through, but the newer revision has it go all the way through. 


The other mod I have on here, is the Umbilical mount for an SB2040, I wanted a non-solder option, so I created this one. It requires 2 m3 heatserts(same as all the other ones in the voron kit,and a m3x6 BHCS or SHCS. 

This is based on the Mini-Fit Jr 4 pin connector that can be found here. https://a.co/d/6VYbvTb 

The wire I use in my system is the igus Chainflex CF9-05-04 this is a 20AWGx4 connector. https://www.igus.com/product/1013?artNr=CF9-05-04 

To install, you wire it, screw in the strain relief, then zip tie it on, when removing, unscrew it, and unclip the Mini-Fit connector.

This is extremely sturdy and has zero issues on my 250 running at 300mms with 3k accels, If you go faster, it may need to be extended, but I don't think it would be. 

All of these are printed in Voron standard 40% infill, grid. 0.2mm

These are all done in Tinkercad, so no source files, sorry! 

Thanks!
